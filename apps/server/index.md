This file creates an HTTP server using the `http` module, which is a built-in Node.js module for creating HTTP servers and clients. The server is created by calling the `createServer` function on the `http` module and passing in the `app` object as the request listener. The `app` object is an Express app that handles the routes and logic for the server.

The server listens on a port specified by the `PORT` environment variable, or `3001` if the environment variable is not set.

This file also imports the `consumeExchangesMessageChannel` calls it after the server has started listening. This function is expected to consume messages from a RabbitMQ message channel.

This file then creates a Socket.io server using the `Server` class from the `socket.io` module and attaches it to the HTTP server. It also sets the `cors` option to allow connections from any origin.

Finally, it creates a Socket.io namespace called `/v1/exchanges` and sets up a connection event listener. When a client connects to this namespace, the `getRealTimeExchangeValuesAction` function is called and passed the `exchangeIo` object, which is the Socket.io namespace. This function is expected to handle the logic for getting real-time exchange values and emitting them to connected clients.
