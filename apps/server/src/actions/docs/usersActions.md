This file exports five functions that perform actions related to users: `signUpAction`, `signInAction`, `getUserAction`, `addBalanceAction` and `removeBalanceAction`.

`signUpAction` is an async function that takes in a `username` and `password` and returns an object with a `status` field and a `success` field. The `success` field is an object with a `doc` field which is an object representing the newly created user and a `token` field which is a JSON Web Token that can be used to authenticate the user. This function first checks if a user with the given `username` already exists. If a user does not already exist, it hashes the `password` using bcrypt and creates a new user with the given `username` and hashed `password` in the database. If a user with the given `username` already exists, it throws a conflict error.

`signInAction` is an async function that takes in a `username` and `password` and returns an object with a `status` field and a `success` field. The `success` field is an object with a `doc` field which is an object representing the user and a `token` field which is a JSON Web Token that can be used to authenticate the user. This function first retrieves the user with the given `username` from the database. If a user with the given `username` does not exist, it throws an unauthorized request error. If a user with the given `username` exists, it checks if the given `password` matches the hashed `password` stored in the database. If the `password` is correct, it returns the user object and a JWT. If the `password` is incorrect, it throws an unauthorized request error.

`getUserAction` is an async function that takes in a `userID` and returns an object with a `status` field and a `success` field. The `success` field is an object with a `doc` field which is an object representing the user and a `token` field which is a JSON Web Token that can be used to authenticate the user. This function retrieves the user with the given `userID` from the database. If a user with the given `userID` does not exist, it throws a not found error. If a user with the given `userID` exists, it returns the user object and a JWT.

`addBalanceAction` is an async function that takes in a `userID`, a `currency`, and an `amount` and returns an object with a `status` field and a `success` field. The `success` field is an object with a `doc` field which is an object representing the updated user. This function updates the user with the given `userID` in the database by adding the given `amount` to the balance of the given `currency` in the user's wallet. If the user does not exist, it throws a not found error.

`removeBalanceAction` is an async function that takes in a `userID`, a `currency`, and an `amount` and returns an object with a `status` field and a `success` field. The `success` field is an object with a `doc` field which is an object representing the updated user. This function updates the user with the given `userID` in the database by subtracting the given `amount` from the balance of the given `currency` in the user's wallet. If the user does not exist, it throws a not found error.
