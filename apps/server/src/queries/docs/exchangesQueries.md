This file exports four functions that perform queries related to exchanges: `getCurrentExchangeValues`, `addExchangeQuery`, `updateExchangeStatusQuery`, and `getExchangesQuery`.

The `getCurrentExchangeValues` function makes a GET request to the FastForex API using the `axios` module and returns the current exchange rate between two currencies. It takes two arguments: `base` and `converted`, which are both strings representing the currencies. The function returns an object with a `status` field and a `data` field. The `status` field is an object with a `code` field (a number) and an `ok` field (a boolean). The data field is an object with three fields: `base`, `converted`, and `exchangeRate`.

The `addExchangeQuery` function creates a new exchange in the database using `prisma`. It takes three arguments: `userID`, `base`, and `convert`. The `userID` is a string representing the ID of the user who made the exchange. The `base` and `convert` arguments are objects with two fields each: `currency` (a string) and `amount` (a number). The function returns an object with a `status` field and a `data` field. The status field is an object with a `code` field (a number) and an `ok` field (a boolean). The `data` field is an object with six fields: `id`, `userID`, `baseCurrency`, `baseAmount`, `convertedCurrency`, and `convertedAmount`.

The `updateExchangeStatusQuery` function updates the status of an exchange in the database using `prisma`. It takes two arguments: `id` and `status`. The `id` is a string representing the ID of the exchange to be updated. The `status` is a string representing the new status of the exchange. The function returns an object with a `status` field and a `data` field. The `status` field is an object with a `code` field (a number) and an `ok` field (a boolean). The `data` field is an object with six fields: `id`, `userID`, `baseCurrency`, `baseAmount`, `convertedCurrency`, and `convertedAmount`.

The `getExchangesQuery` function retrieves a paginated list of exchanges from the database using `prisma`. It takes two arguments: `userID` and `page`. The `userID` is a string representing the ID of the user whose exchanges should be retrieved. The `page` is a number representing the page number. The function returns an object with a `status` field and a `data` field. The `status` field is an object with a `code` field (a number) and an `ok` field (a boolean). The `data` field is an array of objects, each representing an exchange with six fields: `id`, `userID`, `baseCurrency`, `baseAmount`, `convertedCurrency`, and `convertedAmount`. The exchanges are sorted by their creation date in descending order.

Each of these functions also has error handling implemented using the catchErrorHandler function, which is designed to catch and handle any errors that occur during the execution of the function. If an error occurs, the function will throw
