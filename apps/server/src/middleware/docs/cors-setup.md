This file defines a middleware function for setting up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers in the server's responses.

The middleware function is of the `RequestHandler` type, which is a type provided by the `express` module for request handling middlewares. It takes three arguments: the request object, the response object, and the next middleware function in the chain.

The middleware function sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*`, which allows any origin to access the server's resources. It also sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header to a list of headers that are allowed in requests.

If the request method is `OPTIONS`, the function sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header to a list of HTTP methods that are allowed in requests.

Finally, the middleware function calls the next middleware function in the chain.

The middleware function is exported as the default export.
