This file defines a middleware function for checking the authenticity of an access token.

The middleware function is of the `RequestHandler` type, which is a type provided by the `express` module for request handling middlewares. It takes four arguments: the request object, the response object, the next middleware function in the chain, and a type parameter for the request data.

The middleware function first checks if the request has an `Authorization` header. If it doesn't, it throws an `APIError` object for an unauthorized request.

If the `Authorization` header is present, the function extracts the access token from the header and verifies it using the `jwt.verify` function from the `jsonwebtoken` module. The `JWT_KEY` environment variable is used as the secret for verifying the token.

If the token is valid, the user ID stored in the token payload is added to the request object as a property called `accessTokenID`. The next middleware function in the chain is then called.

If the token is not valid, the function throws an `APIError` object for an unauthorized request.

Finally, the middleware function is exported as the default export.
