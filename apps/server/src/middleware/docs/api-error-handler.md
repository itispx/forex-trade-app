This file defines an error handling middleware function for handling errors thrown by the Express app.

The middleware function is of the `ErrorRequestHandler` type, which is a type provided by the `express` module for error handling middlewares. It takes four arguments: an error object, the request object, the response object, and the next middleware function in the chain.

The middleware function checks if the error object is an instance of the `APIError` class, which is a custom error class. If it is, it returns a JSON response to the client with the status and error message from the `APIError` object. If the `APIError` object doesn't have a status code, the function returns a 500 Internal Server Error response.

If the error object is not an instance of the APIError class, the function returns a 500 Internal Server Error response with a default message.

Finally, the middleware function is exported as the default export.
