The file above contains three request handlers that are used to handle user-related actions in an Express server. These actions include signing up a user, signing in a user, and getting a user's information.

`signUpController` is a request handler that receives a request to sign up a new user. It expects the request body to contain a `username` and a `password`, and it returns a JSON object containing a status object and a `success` object. If either the `username` or the `password` is missing, the request handler will throw a `badRequest` error.

`signInController` is a request handler that receives a request to sign in an existing user. It expects the request body to contain a `username` and a `password`, and it returns a JSON object containing a status object and a `success` object. If either the `username` or the `password` is missing, the request handler will throw a `badRequest` error.

`getUserController` is a request handler that receives a request to get the information of an existing user. It expects no params. It returns a JSON object containing a status object and a `success` object. If the request does not contain an `accessTokenID`, retrieve from the `checkToken` middleware, the request handler will throw a `unauthorizedRequest` error.
