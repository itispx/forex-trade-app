The file above contains two request handlers that are used to handle exchange-related actions in an Express server. These actions are making a request and retrieving a list of past exchanges.

The `makeExchangeController` is an express request handler that allows the user to make an exchange between two currencies. It takes in a request and response object and an optional next function, and returns a JSON object with a status and success field.

The `getExchangesController` is another express request handler that allows the user to retrieve a list of their past exchanges. It also takes in a request and response object and an optional next function, and returns a JSON object with a status and success field. It expects a `page` query parameter to be provided in the request, which specifies which page of exchanges to retrieve.

Both of these controllers require the user to be authenticated, and will throw an `APIError.unauthorizedRequest()` if the user is not authenticated.
