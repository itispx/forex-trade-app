This file imports the `PrismaClient` class from the `Prisma` module and creates a new `prisma` object using it. The `PrismaClient` class is the main entry point for using the Prisma client in your application.

The `prisma` object is then exported as the default export. It can be used to make queries and mutations to a database using the Prisma client's API. For example, you can use the `prisma.exchange.create` method to create a new exchange in the database.
