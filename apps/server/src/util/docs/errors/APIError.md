This file defines a custom `APIError` class that implements an `IAPIError` interface. The interface is expected to have two properties: `status`, which is an object with a `code` and an `ok` property, and `error`, which is an object with a `message` property.

The `APIError` class extends the built-in `Error` class and has a constructor that takes a `code` and a `message` argument. The constructor sets the `status` and `error` properties of the `APIError` object based on the provided `code` and `message`. It also sets the prototype of the `APIError` object to the `APIError.prototype` so that the object can be properly recognized as an instance of the `APIError` class.

The `APIError` class has several static methods for creating `APIError` objects with predefined status codes and messages:

- `unauthorizedRequest`: creates an `APIError` object with a 401 Unauthorized status code and a message of "Unauthorized".

- `badRequest`: creates an `APIError` object with a 422 Bad Request status code and a message of "Bad request".

- `notFound`: creates an `APIError` object with a 404 Not Found status code and a message of "Document not found".

- `conflict`: creates an `APIError` object with a 409 Conflict status code and a message of "Conflict".

- `internal`: creates an `APIError` object with a 500 Internal Server Error status code and a message of "Something went wrong".

The code also defines two helper functions: `isOk` and `checkCode`. The `isOk` function takes a status code as an argument and returns `true` if the code is a success code (`200`, `201`, or `304`) or false if it is not. The `checkCode` function takes a status code as an argument and returns the code if it is a number, or `500` if it is not. These functions are used to set the `status` property of the `APIError` object.

Finally, the `APIError` class is exported as the default export.
