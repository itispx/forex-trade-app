The `http` function is a utility function in a JavaScript application that creates an instance of the `axios` HTTP client with a base URL and an authorization header. It utilizes the `getUserToken` function, which is imported from `../utilities/getUserToken`, to retrieve the user's access token.

The `http` function uses the `axios.create` method to create a new instance of the `axios` client with a base URL of `http://localhost:3001/v1` and an authorization header that includes the user's access token. The `axios.create` method returns a new instance of the `axios` client, which can be used to make HTTP requests.

The `http` function is an async function and returns a Promise that resolves to the new `axios` client instance. It is intended to be used as a utility function that can be imported and called in other parts of the application.

Finally, the `http` function is exported as the default export, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application. The `baseURL` constant is also exported as a named export, so it can be used in other parts of the application that need to make HTTP requests to the same base URL.
