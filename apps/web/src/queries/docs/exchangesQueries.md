The `performExchangeQuery` and `getExchangesQuery` functions are utility functions in a JavaScript application that make HTTP requests to a backend server to perform an exchange or retrieve a list of exchanges, respectively. They utilize the http function, which is imported from `./http-common`, to create an instance of the axios HTTP client.

The `performExchangeQuery` async function is an async function that takes in an object with two properties: `base` and `convert`. This object should implement the `IExchangeInfo` interface. The function makes a POST request to the `/exchanges` endpoint of the backend server using the `axios` client's `post` method, passing in the `base` and `convert` properties as the request body. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response data from the server, which is expected to implement the `IQuery` interface and include a `success` property with an `doc` property that is an object implementing the `IExchange` interface.

The `getExchangesQuery` async function is an async function that takes in a single argument, `page`, which is a number representing the page of exchanges to retrieve. It makes a GET request to the `/exchanges` endpoint of the backend server using the `axios` client's `get` method, passing in the `page` number as a query parameter. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response data from the server, which is expected to implement the `IQuery` interface and include a `success` property with an `docs` property that is an array of objects implementing the `IExchange` interface.

Both functions are intended to be used as utility functions that can be imported and called in other parts of the application to make HTTP requests to the backend server. They are exported as named exports, so they can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
