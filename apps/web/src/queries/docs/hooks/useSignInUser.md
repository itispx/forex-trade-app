The `useSignInUser` function is a custom hook that makes a query to sign in a user. It utilizes the `useMutation` hook from the `react-query` library, which is a hook for making mutations and tracking their loading state in a React application.

The `useMutation` hook takes in two arguments: a function that makes the mutation, and an options object. In this case, the function that makes the mutation is `signInUserQuery`. The options object includes two properties: `onSuccess` and `onError`.

The `onSuccess` property is a function that is called when the mutation is successful. In this case, the function checks if the data returned from the mutation has a `status.code` property of 200 and displays a success toast message using the `toast.success` method from the `react-toastify` library if it does. It also caches the data using the setQueryData method and calls the close function that is passed as an argument to the `useSignInUser` hook.

The `onError` property is a function that is called when the mutation encounters an error. In this case, the function displays an error toast message using the `toast.error` method from the `react-toastify` library.

The `useSignInUser` hook also utilizes the `useTranslation` hook from the `next-i18next` library, which allows the application to support multiple languages. This hook returns an object with a `t` property that is a function for translating a string. In this case, the `t` function is used to translate the string "sign_in_successful" and "something_went_wrong" and display them in the success and error toast messages, respectively.

The `useMutation` hook returns an object with two properties: `mutate`, which is a function that can be called to trigger the mutation, and `isLoading`, which is a boolean value that indicates whether the mutation is currently in progress. The `useSignInUser` hook returns this object.

Finally, the `useSignInUser` hook is exported as the default export, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
