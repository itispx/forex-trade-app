The `usePostExchange` function is a custom hook that makes a query to perform an exchange. It utilizes the `useMutation` hook from the `react-query` library, which is a hook for making mutations and tracking their loading state in a React application.

The `useMutation` hook takes in two arguments: a function that makes the mutation, and an options object. In this case, the function that makes the mutation is `performExchangeQuery`. The options object includes three properties: `onSuccess`, `onError`, and `onSettled`.

The `onSuccess` property is a function that is called when the mutation is successful. In this case, the function checks if the data returned from the mutation has a `status.code` property of 201 and displays a success toast message using the `toast.success` method from the `react-toastify` library if it does. It also calls the `close` function that is passed as an argument to the `usePostExchange` hook.

The `onError` property is a function that is called when the mutation encounters an error. In this case, the function displays an error toast message using the `toast.error` method from the `react-toastify` library.

The `onSettled` property is a function that is called when the mutation has completed, regardless of whether it was successful or encountered an error. In this case, the function invalidates the "user" and "exchanges" queries, this ensures that these queries are refetched the next time they are needed.

The `usePostExchange` hook also utilizes the `useTranslation` hook from the `next-i18next` library, which allows the application to support multiple languages. This hook returns an object with a `t` property that is a function for translating a string. In this case, the `t` function is used to translate the strings "exchange_successful" and "something_went_wrong" and display them in the success and error toast messages, respectively.

The `useMutation` hook returns an object with two properties: `mutate`, which is a function that can be called to trigger the mutation, and `isLoading`, which is a boolean value that indicates whether the mutation is currently in progress. The `usePostExchange` hook returns this object.

Finally, the `usePostExchange` hook is exported as the default export, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
