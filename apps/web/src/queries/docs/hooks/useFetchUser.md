The `useFetchUser` function is a custom hook that makes query to retrieve a user's data. It utilizes the `useQuery` hook from the `react-query` library, which is a hook for fetching and caching data in a React application.

The `useQuery` hook takes in three arguments: a key for the query, a function that makes the query, and an options object. In this case, the key is "user" and the function that makes the query is `getUserQuery`. The options object includes the `select` property, which is a function that takes the data returned from the query and processes it. In this case, the function checks if the data has a `status.ok` property and returns the data if it does. If the data does not have a `status.ok` property, it displays an error toast message using the `toast.error` method from the `react-toastify` library.

The `useFetchUser` hook also utilizes the `useTranslation` hook from the `next-i18next` library, which allows the application to support multiple languages. This hook returns an object with a `t` property that is a function for translating a string. In this case, the `t` function is used to translate the string "something_went_wrong" and display it in the error toast message.

The `useFetchUser` hook returns an object with a single property, `data`, which is the data returned from the query. The type of this data is a combination of the `IQuery` and `IUserServerResponse` interfaces, which are imported from the `interfaces-common` module.

Finally, the `useFetchUser` hook is exported as the default export, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
