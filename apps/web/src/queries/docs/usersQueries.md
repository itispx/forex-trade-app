The `signUpUserQuery`, `signInUserQuery`, and `getUserQuery` functions are utility functions in a JavaScript application that make HTTP requests to a backend server to sign up a user, sign in a user, or retrieve the authenticated user's data, respectively. They utilize the `http` function, which is imported from `./http-common`, to create an instance of the axios HTTP client.

The `signUpUserQuery` async function is an async function that takes in an object with two properties: `username` and `password`. It makes a POST request to the `/users/signup` endpoint of the backend server using the `axios` client's `post` method, passing in the `username` and `password` properties as the request body. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response data from the server, which is expected to implement the `IQuery` interface and include a `success` property with an object implementing the `IUserServerResponse` interface.

The `signInUserQuery` async function is an async function that takes in an object with two properties: `username` and `password`. It makes a POST request to the `/users/signin` endpoint of the backend server using the `axios` client's `post` method, passing in the `username` and `password` properties as the request body. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response data from the server, which is expected to implement the `IQuery` interface and include a `success` property with an object implementing the `IUserServerResponse` interface.

The `getUserQuery` function is an async function that does not take in any arguments. It is a utility function in a JavaScript application that makes an HTTP request to a backend server to retrieve the authenticated user's data. It utilizes the `http` function, which is imported from `./http-common`, to create an instance of the `axios` HTTP client. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response data from the server, which is expected to implement the `IQuery` interface and include a `success` property with an object implementing the `IUserServerResponse` interface. If the user's access token is not present, the function returns `undefined`.
