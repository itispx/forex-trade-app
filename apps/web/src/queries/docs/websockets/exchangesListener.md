The `exchangesListener` function is a utility function in a JavaScript application that listens for real-time updates to exchange rates using Socket.IO. It takes in a single argument, a callback function `func`, which is called when new exchange rate data is received.

The function starts by importing the `io` function from the `socket.io-client` library and the `baseURL` constant from `../http-common`. It then initializes a Socket.IO client connection to the server at the `/exchanges` endpoint of the `baseURL`.

If the socket is not already connected, it calls the `connect` method to establish a connection. It then sets up an event listener for the "get-forex-data" event using the `on` method, and passes the received data to the `func` callback function when the event is emitted.

The `exchangesListener` function has no return value. It is intended to be used as a utility function that can be imported and called in other parts of the application.

Finally, the `exchangesListener` function is exported as the default export, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application. The Socket.IO client connection is also exported as a named export, `socket`, so it can be used to emit events or close the connection when needed.
