The code provided is a Next.js page component that displays a list of exchanges made by a user.

## Imported variables and functions:

- `useRouter` from `next/router` which allows the component to access the Next.js router and perform actions such as navigating to different pages.
- `useTranslation` from `next-i18next` which allows the component to access translations for different languages
- `toast` from `react-toastify` which allows the component to display notifications to the user
- `useTable` and `Column` from `react-table` which allow the component to display a table of data
- `getExchangesQuery` which is a function that fetches a list of exchanges from the server.

The component then defines a `getStaticProps` function that is used to fetch translations for the component at build time. This allows the component to display translations for different languages without the need to make a request to the server at runtime.

The functional component start by using the `useTranslation` hook to get the `t` function, which allows the component to access translations for different languages. It also uses the `useRouter` hook to get the `push` function, which allows the component to navigate to different pages.

The component then uses the `getUserQueryData` function to fetch the data for the currently logged-in user. If the user's data is not available, the component uses the `push` function to navigate to the dashboard page.

The component then defines a number of state variables using the `useState` hook, including `isLoading`, which indicates whether the component is currently fetching data from the server, `data`, which stores the list of exchanges to be displayed in the table, and `refetch`, which is used to trigger a refetch of the exchanges data when necessary.

The component then defines the `getExchangesHandler` function, which is used to fetch a list of exchanges from the server. This function sets the `isLoading` state variable to `true` while it is fetching the data, and then makes a request to the server using the `getExchangesQuery` function. If the request is successful, the function parses the data and adds it to the `data` state variable. If the request fails, the function displays an error notification to the user using the `toast.error` function.

The component then uses the `useEffect` hook to trigger the `getExchangesHandler` function when the component mounts or when the refetch state variable changes.

The component then defines the `exchangesData` variable using the `useMemo` hook, which is used to create a copy of the `data` state variable to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the component.

The component then defines the `columns` variable using the `useMemo` hook, which is used to define the columns of the data table that will be displayed to the user.

The component then uses the `useTable` hook to create a table component with the specified columns and data. The component has the ability to load more data when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.
