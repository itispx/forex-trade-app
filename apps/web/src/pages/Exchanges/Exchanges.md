This is a Next.js page that displays a list of exchanges made by a user. It uses the `useTable` hook from `react-table` to display the exchanges in a table.

The `ExchangesPage` function uses the `useRouter` hook to navigate to the dashboard page if the user is not authenticated.

It initializes a few state variables: `isLoading`, `data`, and `refetch`. `isLoading` is a boolean that indicates whether the page is currently loading data from the server. `data` is an array of `IParsedExchange` objects that represent the exchanges to be displayed in the table. refetch is a boolean that, when set to `true`, triggers a refetch of the data from the server.

The `getExchangesHandler` function makes a request to the server for a list of exchanges made by the user. It parses the data received from the server and stores it in the data state variable.

The page uses the `useEffect` hook to call `getExchangesHandler` when the component is mounted, and to refetch the data when the refetch state variable changes.

The `exchangesData` variable is a memoized version of the `data` state variable, which ensures that the data is not unnecessarily re-computed.

The `columns` array defines the columns that will be displayed in the table. Each element of the array is a `Column` object that specifies the header text, accessor function, and cell renderer for the column.

The `tableInstance` variable is obtained by calling the `useTable` hook with the `columns` and `exchangesData` variables as arguments. It contains various properties and functions that can be used to render the table.

The remaining code in the function uses the `tableInstance` variable to render the table and its contents. The `getTableProps`, `getTableBodyProps`, and `headerGroups` properties are used to apply props to the `table`, `tbody`, and `thead` elements, respectively. The `rows` property is an array of objects that represent the rows of the table, and the `prepareRow` function is used to prepare a row for rendering.

The `/* eslint-disable react/jsx-key */` comment at the top of the file disables the ESLint rule that requires a unique `key` prop to be specified for each element in a list because the `key` prop is passed automatically by react-table.
