The `DashboardPage` component is a Next.js page that displays a list of currency exchange rates. It fetches the data for these exchange rates via websockets using the `exchangesListener` function, which listens for updates to the exchange rates and updates the component's state when new data is received. The component also displays a loading spinner while the data is being fetched.

The `getStaticProps` function is a Next.js function that is called at build time to fetch the data that will be passed to the page as props. In this case, it is used to fetch the translations for the page using the `serverSideTranslations` function. These translations are then passed to the page as props.

The page contains either a loading spinner or a list of `ExchangeRateInfo` components, each of which displays information about a single exchange rate. The exchange rate data is passed to these components as props.
