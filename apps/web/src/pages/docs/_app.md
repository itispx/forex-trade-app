The `App` component is a higher-order component (HOC) in a Next.js application that wraps the root component of the app and adds functionality to it. It is the entry point for the app and is rendered on every page of the app. It is responsible for setting up the global styles, providing i18n functionality to the app using the `appWithTranslation` HOC from the `next-i18next` library, and setting up the `react-query` and `react-toastify` libraries.
