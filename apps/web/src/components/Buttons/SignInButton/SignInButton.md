This is a functional component in React that displays a button that, when clicked, opens a modal for signing in.

`const { t } = useTranslation("auth")` uses the `useTranslation` hook to get the `t` function for the `"auth"` namespace. The `t` function can be used to translate strings, and the `i18n` object contains information about the current language and i18n functionality.

Functions `openModal` and `closeModal` are used to handle the visibility of the `SignInModal`.
