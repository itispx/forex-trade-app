This is a functional component in React that displays a form for buying a currency. The form has a single input for the amount of the currency to be bought and a submit button.

## Imported variables and functions:

- `useTranslation`: This is a hook from the `next-i18next` library that provides internationalization functionality. It gives you access to translated strings and the i18n instance.
- `Formik`: This is a library that helps with handling form logic in React.
- `yup`: This is a library for object schema validation.
- `TextFormField`: This is a custom component that represents a form field for text input.
- `Loading`: This is a custom component that represents a loading indicator.

## Component's props and the variables defined within the component:

- `Props`: This is an interface that defines the shape of the component's props object. It has three properties: `submitHandler`, which is a function; `isLoading`, which is a boolean; and `inputRef`, which is an optional function.
- `submitHandler`: This is a prop that represents a function to be called when the form is submitted.
- `isLoading`: This is a prop that represents whether the form is currently being submitted.
- `inputRef`: This is an optional prop that represents a function to be called with the formik instance as an argument when the component is mounted.
- `t: tCommon`: This is a function that takes a key and returns the corresponding translated string in the "common" namespace.
- `buySchema`: This is an object that represents a validation schema for the form using the yup library. It defines the `amount` field as a required number with a minimum value of 0.1.
- `initialValues`: This is an object that represents the initial values for the form's fields.

The component returns a form that contains a `Formik` component with the `validationSchema`, `initialValues`, and `onSubmit` props set to the values of `buySchema`, `initialValues`, and `submitHandler`, respectively. It also has an `innerRef` prop set to the value of the `inputRef` prop passed to the component. The `Formik` component renders a div with the form's input and submit button inside. The input is a `TextFormField` component and the submit button is a div with a click handler that calls the `submitForm` method from the `Formik` component. The submit button is replaced with a loading indicator if the `isLoading` prop is `true`.
