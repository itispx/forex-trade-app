This is a functional component in React that displays exchange rate information and a button that, when clicked, opens a modal for buying the currency.

## Imported variables and functions:

- `useTranslation`: This is a hook from the `next-i18next` library that provides internationalization functionality. It gives you access to translated strings and the i18n instance.
- `getUserQueryData`: This is a function that retrieves user data from `react-query` local storage.
- `toast`: This is a function from the `react-toastify` library that displays notifications (toasts) on the screen.
- `BuyModal`: This is a custom component that represents a modal for buying a currency.
- `IExchangeConversion`: This is an interface that defines the shape of an object that represents exchange rate information. It is imported from an `interfaces-common` module.

## Component's props and the variables defined within the component:

- `Props`: This is an interface that defines the shape of the component's props object. It has one property: `exchangeInfo`, which is of type - `IExchangeConversion`.
- `exchangeInfo`: This is a prop that represents exchange rate information. It includes the base currency, the converted currency, and the - exchange rate.
- `t: tCommon`: This is a function that takes a key and returns the corresponding translated string in the "common" namespace.
- `t: tToast`: This is a function that takes a key and returns the corresponding translated string in the "toast" namespace.
- `showModal`: This is a state variable that keeps track of whether the buy modal is currently being shown.
- `setShowModal`: This is a function that updates the value of the `showModal` state variable.
- `openModal`: This is a function that sets the value of `showModal` to `true`, causing the modal to be displayed.
- `closeModal`: This is a function that sets the value of `showModal` to `false`, causing the modal to be hidden.
- `buyHandler`: This is a function that is called when the buy button is clicked. It retrieves user data from `react-query` and displays a notification if the user is not signed in or does not have sufficient money. Otherwise, it opens the buy modal.

The component returns a div with the exchange rate information displayed inside, as well as a button that, when clicked, calls the `buyHandler` function. It also includes a `BuyModal` component with the `show` and `close` props set to the values of `showModal` and `closeModal`, respectively, and the `exchangeInfo` prop set to the value of the `exchangeInfo` prop passed to the component. This allows the modal to be displayed when the button is clicked and closed when the close button in the modal is clicked. The modal also has access to the exchange rate information that was passed to the parent component.
