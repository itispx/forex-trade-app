The TextFormField component is a form field that accepts a text input from the user. It has the following props:

- `id`: a unique identifier for the input element
- `name`: the name of the input element
- `type`: the type of the input element (e.g. `text`, `password`, `email`)
- `placeholder`: the placeholder text that appears in the input element
- `value`: the value of the input element
- `onChange`: a function that is called when the value of the input element changes
- `onBlur`: a function that is called when the input element loses focus
- `touched`: a boolean indicating whether the input element has been interacted with
- `errors`: a string containing any error messages to display
- `inputProps`: any additional props to be passed to the input element

The component displays a label element and an input element. It also displays an error message if the input has been touched and it is invalid.
