The `LanguageSwitcher` component is a dropdown menu that allows the user to select a language for the app to be displayed in. It is implemented using the `Dropdown` component from the `react-dropdown` library, and uses the `i18n` object from the `next-i18next` library to handle language switching.

The component has an array of language options, `lngs`, which contains objects with the `value` and `label` properties. The `value` property is the language code (e.g. "en-US" for English - US), and the `label` property is the language name to be displayed in the dropdown menu. When a language is selected from the dropdown menu, the `handleChange` function is called and the `i18n` object's `changeLanguage` method is used to switch the language. The current language is displayed as the dropdown menu's placeholder, and is determined by finding the `lngs` option that has a `value` property that matches the `i18n` object's `language` property.
