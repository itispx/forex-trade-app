The `Layout` component is a wrapper component that is used to provide a consistent layout for the application. It contains a `MainNavigation` component that is displayed at the top of the layout and any children components that are passed to it. The Layout component does not have any props of its own and simply renders the children components passed to it.

To use the `Layout` component, you can pass any React elements as children to the component. These children elements will be rendered within the layout.

```js
import Layout from "./Layout";

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>My Page</h1>
      <p>Some content on my page</p>
    </Layout>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Layout` component will render a `MainNavigation` component at the top and the `h1` and `p` elements passed as children to the `Layout` component.
